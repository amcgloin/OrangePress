    <h1 id="header">Redlands Orange Press</h1><h2 id='bio_header'>Find something to do!</h2><p id='bio_text'>Redlands offers a lot to its residents! But it can be hard to find the group for your passions and interests. I made this site to help you find the people to bike with, read with, or do whatever else you like to do—or want to like to do!—in town. If you want to add additional events or places, you can email me at aidancmcgloin@gmail.com. <br><br>—Aidan</p>
